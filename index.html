                        Hi, my name is <h3 style="display:inline;">Christopher Lee</h3>!
                        <p>
                            I am currently a first-year student at Kenyon College pursuing a bachelor's degree, intending to major
                            in
                            Economics with
                            a Scientific Computing concentration. Passions of mine include software development, machine learning,
                            algorithmic
                            trading, and investment portfolio management.

                            In my free time, I enjoy programming Python projects or developing iOS apps with Swift. I also

                                I have always been fascinated by algorithmic trading. Thus, I created
                                TradeBot, a Python program that calculates buy and sell signals based on technical
                                indicators. The program tracks one symbol and each minute, gets market data
                                from Alpaca API and adds that data to an SQLite database. Every hour, TradeBot
                                will calculate the indicators and determine if it should buy, sell, or do nothing
                                based on certain criteria.

                                TremorAnalysis is an app I started development on in June 2020. My father, a neurologist, had
                                always said he was searching for an app that he could use that would measure his patients'
                                tremor frequencies. I attempted to solve this problem by creating TremorAnalysis. TremorAnalysis
                                utilizes Apple's Accelerate framework in order to compute the component frequency by using Fast
                                Fourier
                                Transform. TremorAnalysis also uses Core Motion to gather accelerometer data. I used SwiftUI as this
                                is
                                Apple's future framework and I would like to have a strong understanding of SwiftUI.

                            <p>
                                InvestingForAll is my first app I developed with SwiftUI. When I started learning the basics of
                                investing, I was constantly searching
                                for a simple investment app that could simulate a real portfolio, but without the risk of using real
                                money. This lead me to create my own app
                                that fetched data from a stock API (IEX) and present it in a user-friendly way.
                                I initally created InvestingForAll with Swift in 2019; however, as
                                soon as SwiftUI was released, I immediatly recreated it with SwiftUI and expanded on its features.
                                InvestingForAll features
                                an overview of market statistics such as the performance of sectors and indices. It also provides a
                                search feature
                                to search for a given stock and provides the user with a detailed quote, including a chart of
                                historical prices.
                                The main feature, however, was the simulated investment portfolio. Users could buy and sell
                                simulated stocks during market hours
                                it would track the performance of their portfolio.
